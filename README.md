How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 
- Graceful degradation is a principle that desires to provide users with a baseline experience even with older browsers or no network capacity. Service workers are related to graceful degradation because they allow web applications to continue working offline. They allow web apps to still be usable even if there is no network connection or cache, and they receive the network requests you send out from your web app.
